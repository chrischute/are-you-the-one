# How to beat *[Are You The One?](http://www.mtv.com/shows/are-you-the-one)*
*Are You The One?* is a reality TV show on MTV in which ten men and ten women are grouped together. There are ten pairs of soulmates, and their goal is to guess these pairs in ten weeks or fewer.

Our goal is to prove that this can always be done, and with no knowledge of the contestants' personalities. We do so with a multi-threaded C++ simulation of a simple guessing algorithm, and show how it performs on all possible pairings of the contestants. If it can always win in 10 weeks, nobody should ever lose on *Are You The One?*
